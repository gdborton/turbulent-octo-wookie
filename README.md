# Simply Social

## Inferences

These are the sorts of things that I'd normally work with ux to figure out.  Below are some assumptions that I made since I don't have a direct line of communication with the team that made the prototypes.

 - Like and reply buttons appear on top of the list view posts, but on the bottom of the tiled posts, assumption is that this was intentional.
 - Vertical white line on `What's on your mind?` component in psd is a cursor.
 - Provided fonts and fonts in the psd differ, assuming fonts reported by Photoshop to be accurate.
 - Header scrolls on the InVision prototype on one screen, but not others. Assuming that majority rules, and it shouldn't be fixed on the page.
 - Fonts are occasionally inconsistent between InVision prototype and psd.  This is most apparent in the `Create new message` modal's lower case g's descender.
 - The last three options on the settings page are independent, and should be checkboxes.

## Concessions
 - It seems as thought > IE9 doesn't have support for `filter: blur()`.  There are js solutions, but that's a bit beyond the scope of this exercise I think.
